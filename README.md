# 30-Days-Python-
Recently, I joined a 30-Day Python Challenge to revise all the core concepts of Python and prepare myself for the next milestone. Being a mother, I prefer to focus on learning one skill at a time.

Today is Day 1 of my challenge, and I have set up my working environment to begin my coding journey.

As we know, Python code can be run on several IDEs like IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, and PyCharm, among others.

For this challenge, I chose to work with VS Code because it's user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with GitHub for version control.

‚úÖ Tasks I completed on Day 1:
Downloaded and installed the VS Code environment

Installed Python

Installed the Python extension in VS Code

Created a GitHub repository for documentation

I also revised the important Git commands like:

clone

add

commit

merge

push

pull

pull request (PR)

I refreshed my understanding of merging, managing conflicts, and forking a repository for version control and collaboration.

Finally, I wrapped up the day by writing a simple one-line Python program:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello World, this is [Your Name]!")
Feeling excited and ready for Day 2! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª
